Hi, Tom,

I have attached a spreadsheet containing the water depth data collected by CCWG under the railroad tracks in Moro Cojo Slough.

The data was collected from February 1, 2017 to July 23, 2017, and  from October 23, 2017 to March 13, 2018.

As we discussed on the phone Friday, Waterways used this data to create a water surface elevation profile in NAVD88 feet datum.

We surveyed an elevation of the bolt that holds the logger in place in the slough using GPS. This was done in October, 2017.  Using this elevation, combined with the cable and logger length, we were able to determine the water surface elevation.

The data is on three separate sheets in the file due to size. There are overview and monthly charts of the water surface elevations for each of the data sets.

We also determined the number of days the water surface elevation was at or above a certain elevation (Elevation 1, 2, 3 etc.). This has been broken down by percentage and is included on the data set sheets.

Additionally, we determined the average water surface elevation during “wet” and “dry“ seasons, which are also included on the data set sheets. We considered the “wet” season as the period between November 1 and April 30, and the “dry” season to run from May 1 through October 31.

Please have a look and let me know if I can answer any questions you may have. I will be out of the office for the rest of the week after today.

Respectfully,
